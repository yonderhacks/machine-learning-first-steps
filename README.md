Fast-paced **tutorial** for beginners on **Machine Learning**, using **Anaconda** and **Python 3**. Find us at an **event** near you, or have us come to **yours**.

However, if you prefer to be more innovative with your experience and follow this tutorial on your own, we recommend a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) computer. You'd be suprised what support **Raspberry Pi** users enjoy from the **Developer ecosystem**. Plus, we'd love you to do just that and we're ready to help.
